# Python-for-Data-Science

This Data Science program covers the essential parts of the Python programming language that helped me a lot during the journey of this course. Throughout the course I learned to prepare data better for analysis and allows to quickly deploy models. Following concepts are covered in this program

Fundamentals of Python language
Object Oriented Programming and other advanced concepts
Manipulating matrices using NumPy
Data Wrangling with Pandas
Visualizing Data using Matplotlib


Projects completed in this course are:
1. Student Management System
Problem Statement: You have been hired by the University of Data Science to manage their students' records. Your job is to create the student management system for the university. Let's try to build the system using basic Python operations.

Outcomes
After completing this project, I got to know how to solve basic Python problems. 
In this project, I applied the following concepts:

Mathematical operations
List operations
Dictionary operations
String indexing and formatting

2. Spy Games
Problem Statement: It's with an emergency that our agency wishes to use the skills that you learned in 'python intermediate' module. Your mission if you choose to accept it, would be to help us decipher a message that we received from our intel. We have multiple text files that need to be read and have certain operations performed to get our final message.

Outcomes
After completing this project,I have a better understanding of solving logical problems using python. 
In this project, I applied the following concepts:

String operations
Conditional statement and loops
File I/O
Functions
