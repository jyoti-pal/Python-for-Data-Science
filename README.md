# Python-for-Data-Science

This Data Science program covers the essential parts of the Python programming language that helped me a lot during the journey of this course. Throughout the course I learned to prepare data better for analysis and allows to quickly deploy models. Following concepts are covered in this program

Fundamentals of Python language
Object Oriented Programming and other advanced concepts
Manipulating matrices using NumPy
Data Wrangling with Pandas
Visualizing Data using Matplotlib


Projects completed in this course are:
1. Student Management System

Problem Statement: You have been hired by the University of Data Science to manage their students' records. Your job is to create the student management system for the university. Let's try to build the system using basic Python operations.

Outcomes
After completing this project, I got to know how to solve basic Python problems. 
In this project, I applied the following concepts:

Mathematical operations
List operations
Dictionary operations
String indexing and formatting

2. Spy Games

Problem Statement: It's with an emergency that our agency wishes to use the skills that you learned in 'python intermediate' module. Your mission if you choose to accept it, would be to help us decipher a message that we received from our intel. We have multiple text files that need to be read and have certain operations performed to get our final message.

Outcomes: After completing this project,I have a better understanding of solving logical problems using python. 
In this project, I applied the following concepts:

String operations
Conditional statement and loops
File I/O
Functions

3. Analyzing Movie Data Set

Problem Statement:Our aim in this project is to explore the movie dataset and find some movies with high ratings. Your friend has just begun with his vacations and wants you to suggest some good movies for him to watch. In the dataset, we have the details of the movies in more than 50 languages, but your friend is interested only in watching English movies. Thus, our goal is to analyze the data and suggest English movies with high-ratings to your friend.

4. Make Sense of Census
Problem Statement
You have been hired by 'CACT'(Census Analysis and Collection Team) to help with your numpy programming skills. Your major work for project involves census record management and data analysis.

About the Dataset

The dataset has details of 100 people with the following 8 features

Features	                 Description
  age	                 Age of the person
education-num	      No. of years of education they had
race	                     Person's race
                    KEY==> 0 : Amer-Indian-Eskimo
                           1 : Asian-Pac-Islander
                           2 : Black
                           3 : Other
                           4 : White
sex	                    Person's gender
                    KEY==> 0 : Female
                           1 : Male
capital-gain	     Income from investment sources, apart from wages/salary
capital loss	     Losses from investment sources, apart from wages/salary
hours-per-week	        No. of hours per week the person works
income	                Annual Income of the person
                    KEY==> 0 : Less than or equal to 50K
                           1 : More than 50K
